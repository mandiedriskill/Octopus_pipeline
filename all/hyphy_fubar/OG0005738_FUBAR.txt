Analysis Description
--------------------
Perform a Fast Unbiased AppRoximate Bayesian (FUBAR) analysis of a
coding sequence alignment to determine whether some sites have been
subject to pervasive purifying or diversifying selection. v2.1
introduces two more methods for estimating the posterior distribution of
grid weights: collapsed Gibbs MCMC (faster) and 0-th order Variation
Bayes approximation (fastest). Please note that a FUBAR analysis
generates a cache and a results JSON file in the same directory as
directory as the original alignment. HyPhy needs to have write
privileges to this directory. For example if the original file is in
/home/sergei/FUBAR/data/pol.nex then at the end of a FUBAR run, there
will also exist FUBAR-generated files
/home/sergei/FUBAR/data/pol.nex.FUBAR.json,
/home/sergei/FUBAR/data/pol.nex.fubrar.cache. They also provide
checkpointing so that a partially completed analysis can be restarted.

## FUBAR inferred 1 sites subject to diversifying positive selection at posterior probability >= 0.9
Of these,  0.10 are expected to be false positives (95% confidence interval of 0-1 )
